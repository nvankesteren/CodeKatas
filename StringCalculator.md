# String Calculator

## First step

Create a function add that takes a String and return a String like `String add(String number)`

* The method can take 0,1 or 2 numbers separated by comma and return their sum,
* an empty string will return “0”
* Example of inputs : “”, “1”, “1.1,2.2”

## Many numbers

Allow the add method to handle an unknown number of arguments

## New separator

Allow the add method to handle new lines as separator

* `1\n2,3` should return 6.
* `175.2,\n35` is invalid and return the message “Number expected but '\n' found at position 6”.

## Missing number in last position

* `1,3,` is invalid and return the message “Number expected but EOF found”.

## Many separator

Allow the add method to handle a different delimiter.

To change the delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like `//[delimiter]\n[numbers]`

Example:
* `//;\n1;2` should return 3
•	`//|\n1|2|3` should return 6
•	`//sep\n2sep3` should return 5
•	`//|\n1|2,3` is invalid and return the message “'|' expected but ',' found at position 3”.

All existing scenarios should work as before.

## Negatives numbers

Calling add with negatives numbers will return the message “Negative not allowed : “ listing all negative numbers that were in the list of numbers

* `-1,2` is invalid and return the message “Negative not allowed : -1”
* `2,-4,-5` is invalid and return the message “Negative not allowed : -4, -5”

## Multiple errors

Calling add with multiple errors will return all errors message separated by new line.

* `-1,,2` is invalid and return the message “Negative not allowed : -1\nNumber expected but ',' found at position 3”.

## Other operations

Write a function for multiply with the same rules.
